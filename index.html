                    Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them.

                    If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. Learn when to stop. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk.
